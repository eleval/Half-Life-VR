1. Extract the archived files (except source folder unless you are compiling) into the root directory of Half-life.

2. You will need to set opengl32.dll to read-only to disallow file deletion.
(The latest version of half-life prevents a modified opengl32.dll and will actively remove opengl32.dll if it is not changed to read-only.)

3. Use the Half-Life VR shortcut and accept the steam dialog prompt to launch the vr mod.
	3a. You can also launch by copying "-game vr -dev -env -console -insecure -nomouse -nojoy +sv_lan 1" to the launch parameters in the steam half-life properties panel.
		
If you try to play Half-life multiplayer with opengl32.dll in the root directory you CAN be VAC banned.
